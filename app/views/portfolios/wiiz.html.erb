      <h3>Skills and knowledge developed</h3>
      <p>I learned to code autonomously because I was the only <br>
        front-end developer of the project and work with a remote <br>
        team because I joined the project during the quarantine time in march. </p>

      <h3>Mains Difficulties</h3>
      <h5 class="ml-3">Organizational </h5>
      <p class="ml-5">I was very autonomous, which can be great and <br>
        positive but I would have liked a little more technical<br>
         advice from the lead developper to progress further.
      <h5 class="ml-3">Technical</h5>
      <p class="ml-5">With all the technical specifications of this application, <br> I think the use of a javascript framework such as React <br>
        or Vue would have been a wise choice. It's very important<br>
        to choose the technical stack according to the project<br>
        specifications.

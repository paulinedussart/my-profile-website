        In 2019, after few years spent in Tourism, I decided  to learn to code. I choose <span>Le Wagon Bootcamp</span>, in 9 weeks we learnt so many things about development (from design, and database to deploy and production). I found myself passionate about creating and bring to life great products. I felt in love with <span>Front-End & Javascript</span>. Now <span>I don't want to stop learning</span>  , I want to continue practise and develop my skills around front-end. With those new knowledge,  I would like to participate to a more ethic and sustainable world. </p>

        In 2019, after few years spent in Tourism, I decided  to learn to code, and I choose <span>Le Wagon Bootcamp</span>. In 9 weeks we learnt so many things about web development (from design, and database to deploy and production). I found myself <span>passionate about creating </span>and bring to life great products. </p>
        <p class="about-text-content grey-text">
          I felt in love with <span>Front-End & Javascript</span>. Now <span>I don't want to stop learning</span>, I want to continue practise and develop my skills around development.
